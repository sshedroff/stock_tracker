# Stock Tracker
This is a simple console-based stock tracker written in Java.  The program interacts
with the [Yahoo Finance API](http://code.google.com/p/yahoo-finance-managed/wiki/YahooFinanceAPIs) 
in order to obtain its data.  This was originally created as part of a learning 
exercise, and is updated irregularly at best.

## Files
* __Tracker.java:__ Program execution point and tracking handler.
* __Stock.java:__ Basic representation of a stock item.
* __stocks.txt:__ Text file containing stock name abbreviations.

## Usage
1. Compile .java files.
2. Place stock name abbreviations into the "stocks.txt" file.
3. Run the program from the compiled Tracker class.
